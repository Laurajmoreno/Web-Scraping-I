# Web-Scraping-I
## Exercise with data formatted as a table
Web Scraping allows us to extract data available on web sites.
Technically, it consists of reading and parsing the html code and then extracting the elements that are valuable to us. Basically, we transform the html input into an appropriate data structure to be processed.
One of the easiest cases and the one that we will deal with in this practice is the data already formatted as tables.
As an example, we will use the 'List of accidents and disasters by death toll' from Wikipedia and more specifically the table related to explosions. Clarification: This list does not include bombings, aviation incidents, or mining disasters.
